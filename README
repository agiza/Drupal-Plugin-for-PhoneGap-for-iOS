Notes on using the Drupal PhoneGap Plugin for iOS

Installation Notes
==================
* Tested with PhoneGap 0.9.6 and XCode 4
* Create a new PhoneGap Application from XCode 4 to get started
* Follow directions under 0.1 to set up XCode Phonegap project - I would like to make this much, much better!
* Add DrupalPlugin.m and DrupalPlugin.h to your XCode PhoneGap project's plugins directory
* Add the javascript file to your XCode project's www directory
* Reference the javascript file in your index.html
* Add DrupalPlugin to your PhoneGap.plist configuration file's list of plugins. Select the last plugin in the list (there are 14 out of the box) and then click the Plus sign. 
* Type "DrupalPlugin" into both boxes of the new plugin and save the file.
* Start using the plugin

Sample Code
==================
//authenticated user
function onDeviceReady()
{
	window.plugins.drupal.login("drupaluser", "password", successCallback,failureCallback);
	var node = {
				 title: "Sample Article",
				 body: { 
				 und: [{
					   value: "Sample Body"
					   }]
				 },
				 type: 'article',
				 language: 'und'
	};
	window.plugins.drupal.nodeSave(node,articleSaveSuccess,failureCallback);
    window.plugins.drupal.logout(successCallback,failureCallback);	
}

//anonymous user
function onDeviceReady()
{
        window.plugins.drupal.openAnonymousSession(successCallback,failureCallback);
        window.plugins.drupal.viewGet("frontpage",frontPageSuccess,failureCallback);
}

Version 0.1
===========
* Requires the Drupal iOS SDK (https://github.com/workhabitinc/drupal-ios-sdk) and ASIHTTPRequest (https://github.com/pokeb/asi-http-request)
* Drupal iOS SDK comes with NSData+Base64, but so does PhoneGap. Remove the NSData+Base64 folder from the Drupal iOS SDK in your XCode project and change the reference in DIOSConnect.h from "NSData+Base64.h" to <PhoneGap/NSData+Base64.h>
* Edit ASIHTTPRequest/ASIHTTPRequest.m to use <PhoneGap/Reachability.h> - PhoneGap bundles Reachability
* You will need to edit DIOSConnect.h to reference your Drupal server there
* Add libz.1.2.3.framework as a Framework for your app
* Add CFNetwork.framework as a Framework for your app

* Currently the plugin only supports a connection to one Drupal site per app

* Currently supported methods from Drupal Services:
user.login
user.logout
system.connect
node.get
node.save
views.get

* Adding more methods should be pretty easy.
